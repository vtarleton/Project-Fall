Fall is the best season of the year, with Spring being my second favorite time.
I love the crisp mornings and the warm days without it being too hot.
There's something special about the leaves changing colors that takes my breath away.
Although this signals the end of Summer, it is a welcome break to the unbearable heat waves.
It also signals that's time to pack up the summer gear and break out the warmer items.
I'm ready for the change!
